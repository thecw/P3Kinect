Sunday morning, a man (around 40-50 years old) shopping with his mother
We saw him sitting himself alone on a bench. He doesn't seem to be be worried/impatient. He wasn't doing anything(including playing with cellphone)
----------------------------------------------
He came here with his Mom(a teacher) to get headphone at radioshark.
Because next week the children in his mother's class will be all in costumn... (@Jim I missed sth here)
They came here around 10:30 (he actually did a lot of things before coming here) .... he was grabbing the food from chipolet while his mother was still shopping in a costumn store.
He like the mall. It is not that crowded(maybe because it is in the morning) and he lives nearby.
And the mall has everyhing in a place.... bath&bath works.. foodcourt and movie
He is gonna go back at 1200.


Sunday noon, a Chinese mother and his boy
----------------------------------------------
They were here to get things sending back to China (to raletives) for the Spring Festival.
The mother and the boy were so happy. The mother is pregnant.
They live nearby, so it is very convinient... they don't need to get up early.
They don't think they have any negtive experience before here.

Sunday afternoon, H&M
----------------------------------------------
When waiting in a line as a family... a mother just ask where is your father??? Then silence....

When the line gets too long at the cashier... someone comes and start a new line on the next direction in the shop

customers sometimes talked to strangers when they are shopping on the same selves/region (esp those round ones). [maybe social shopping app...]

Sunday afternoon, Jim & Lucy  @H&M
We got to talk to them when they are in line
----------------------------------------------
The bad experience is when the line is too long.
Today is the best ever shopping experience because Lucy get to buy XX(@Calvin I missed the point here as well) for the first time.
The shopping habbit for Jim is to go directly to a shop with what he is gonna buy in mind.
Jim said he accompanied his wife going shopping a lot, while Lucy seemed to be disagreed.
They were too tired after two hours shopping and they wanted to go home directly.

Sunday afternoon, Lewis @outside the Hollister
When we saw Lewis he was sitting on the floor by the window with one of his frd who is around 25.
----------------------------------------------
Lewis is 11 years old
He didn't get anything today, but he is still very happy because he was accompanying his friend.
What he wants the most is toy :P 

Sunday afternoon, a guy works in Hollister
-----------------------------------------------
He actually doesn't like his job that much. It was too much greeting to deliver and he only get a bit of money.
While he enjoys getting the chance to get numbers/date cute femail customers :)
For each shift he can get at least one number :P
He got several numbers and he has 5 dates already.
He looks happy at least to me.
